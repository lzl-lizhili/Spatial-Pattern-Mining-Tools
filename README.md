# ArcGIS Python tools for spatial pattern detection

ArcGIS [Python tool scripts](https://github.com/lzl-lizhili/Spatial-Pattern-Mining-Tools/tree/main/code%20for%20geoprocessing%20packages%20in%20ArcGIS%20Pro) for detecting spatial patterns in point datasets. 

## [Bernoulli Hotspot Detection Tool](https://github.com/lzl-lizhili/Spatial-Pattern-Mining-Tools/blob/main/code%20for%20geoprocessing%20packages%20in%20ArcGIS%20Pro/Bernoulli_hotspot.pyt)

This tool aims to detect spatial hotspots within point datasets using a Bernoulli-based scan statistic method. It identifies regions where the observed number of events significantly deviates from what is expected under a null hypothesis (e.g., a region with a high concentration of disease cases in a study area).

## [Mixture Pattern Detection Tool](https://github.com/lzl-lizhili/Spatial-Pattern-Mining-Tools/blob/main/code%20for%20geoprocessing%20packages%20in%20ArcGIS%20Pro/mixture_pattern.pyt)

This tool aims to identify sub-regions with significant deviations in the mixture of different types or classes (e.g., plant species diversity or the composition of disease symptoms) based on geo-located point samples categorized into multiple groups. For example, it can identify regions with a significantly high mixture of tree species in a study area.

## [MSS Mixture Pattern Detection Tool](https://github.com/lzl-lizhili/Spatial-Pattern-Mining-Tools/blob/main/code%20for%20geoprocessing%20packages%20in%20ArcGIS%20Pro/Multinomial_hotspot.pyt)

The Multinomial Scan Statistic (MSS) mixture pattern detection tool aims to detect regions within a study area that exhibit a distinct mixture of various types of points  (e.g., types of diseases)  compared to the mixture outside the region.
